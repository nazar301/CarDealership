# CarDealership

   
   Building a website for a startup dealership. I want it to be easy to use no clutter and pleasing to the eye. The website design will need to be forward and not overbearing.
  Need it to focus soley on the cars and the dealership in name 
  
 
 Want to build a fully usuable website that, lets users create personal accounts. Once the user is signed in they would be able to place custom order for a car that they want to buy. For those that aren't signed in they would be able to look through the site to check on the available cars at the time.
